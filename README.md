# Final-Project
Here is my submission to the Final Project for the R for Economics course. My project consists of an analysis of the Emissions trading systems. I use two different systems : the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and the Western Climate Initiative. It is seprated in different parts : The first part being mostly about data sorting in order to have a clear, usable data set. The second part is mostly about showing the data through the construction of graphs. In the last part, I ran a few regressions but it is important to note that their statistical relevance is practically non existent.
